Module 6 project
Project: Diabetes Detection System

Project Overview

- Build a binary classification model that predicts whether a person has diabetes or not based on medical features.

Dataset

- Use the Given Diabetes Dataset

Features include:

* Pregnancies

* Glucose

* BloodPressure

* SkinThickness

* Insulin

* BMI

* DiabetesPedigreeFunction

* Age

* Outcome (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

Submission Requirements

- Use at least 3 classifiers from:

* Logistic Regression

* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

* Decision Tree

* Random Forest (optional bonus)

- Evaluate using:

* Confusion Matrix

* Precision, Recall, F1-score

* ROC Curve & AUC

- Split data into train/test

- Apply feature scaling where needed

- Use plots to visualize performance

Final Submission

- Share the Google Colab link with link sharing set to "Anyone with the link can view"

- You do not need to download or submit the .ipynb file.

- Ensure that all relevant outputs are visible in the notebook before sharing.
